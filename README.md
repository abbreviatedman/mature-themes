# Mature Themes

### Introduction

This is a start-from-scratch project in which you will build a site with (at least) two themes, which the user can switch between at will. The most important skill you'll be using here is your mastery of manipulating an HTML element's `class` property dynamically. **You may not use any other property that manipulates the style of the element.**. This includes, of course, `Node.style`.

Another important note: the name of this assignment is:

1. a "clever" play on the fact that it will help you mature your theming skills;
2. *not* an invitation to include NSFW content in it;
3. the name of the assignment, not necessarily the name of your project for it. The content and title are up to you!


### Instructions

* As we _just_ said, the content for this site is totally up to you. You can populate it with your own stuff, or lorem ipsum it up.
    If you go the lorem route, [getlorem.com](https://www.getlorem.com) is a good resource, but there are some pretty funny random content generators out there if you feel like looking around.
* The set of themes is also totally up to you. But here are some suggestions:
    * A light theme and dark theme are some pretty basic and simple ones to try.
    * Making one a flat theme is good practice, given the look's popularity.
    * Copying a theme from somewhere is not only totally fine, it's actively encouraged, _as long as you take the time to understand the code you're using._ If you see a style using a CSS rule you don't understand, skip it and see what changes. Or: look it up. Learn! Yay! Yay, learning!
* The only rule for the layout is that it should have a table of information. Do you have to use a `<table>`? No! You _can_ use a `<table>`... or vanilla CSS, or flexbox, or grid, or boostrap, or really any solution.
